# paddle-mx-pcb
Simple 3-switch pcb for mk20 paddle switches.

I'd wanted to have remote mechanisms activate mx switches for my 'paddle switch' functionality.  It ended up being very complicated and unnecessary, difficult to package up.  It would have been simple to have the location complexity be in printable parts, and the pcb be very simple.  Alas.
